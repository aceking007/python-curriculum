#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to convert regular English words into Pig Latin. They will also learn about some functions that will be useful in the pursuit.

#Online Resources
I recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

+ [New (blank) Python Trinket -- jumpto.cc/python-new](http://jumpto.cc/python-new)

There is also a trinket containing the completed project:

+ [PygLatin finished -- trinket](https://trinket.io/embed/python/0ef746b2ca?start=result%22#.XExTK1wzbIU)

#Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred.

You can also find a completed version of this project in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ PygLatin-finished/PygLatin.py


#Learning Objectives
+ Variables;
+ If statements;
+ 'AND' operator;
+ Functions: isalpha(), lower(), len();
+ String indexing;
+ String concatenation.

#Challenges
+ "Better Intro" - Come up with an interesting opening statement that will help people understand more about Pig Latin.
+ "Printing the right way" - String indexing and printing substrings from a string.
+ "Different translations" - Make a different way of writing Pig Latin using different suffixes.
+ "Decoder" - Make a Pig Latin decoder.
